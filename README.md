# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

ex:
npx hardhat verify --network rinkeby 0x7214AB3AC5dE6CDB7aeD213c3Ba0C2591097A34B https://example.com/ https://example.com/ 0xA6431D80240C3a3FeF54Dd2179b2BDC13fEec467 100 1650326400 1650412800
